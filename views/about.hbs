            <div class="text">The Nyan Cat video was first posted to YouTube on April 5, 2011. The original GIF came from artist Christopher Torres‚Äôs website. The name Pop Tart Cat comes from him, since that‚Äôs what he originally called it. The animation itself is a piece of pixel art of a cat flying through space with a Pop-Tart body, followed by a trail of rainbows.</div>
